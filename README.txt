Modeling cold x-ray effects on materials

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECT SUMMARY (Visual in project summary contained in slides)

For this project, the group developed a library to simulate the effects of a high dosage cold x-ray
exposure event and its effect of spacecraft materials. Cold x-ray events deposit significant
amounts of energy on outer facing surfaces which can result in material removal via ablation from
extreme energies and temperatures. The group performed an example simulation on a space radiator,
used to exhaust satellite heat and found the cold x-ray exposure removed the specialized radiator’s
thermal paint and even some of the radiator’s underlying structure.

INSTALLING THE PACKAGE
- This package has been uploaded to PyPI so it can be installed using pip.
- To install, open the command line or Powershell and do the following.
	- Type "pip install coldxrayPy"
	- Press enter
	- pip should notify of installation completion
	- import the package in the Python code where it is to be used.
